Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools for developement and maintenance of a high quality software before a given deadline and within a budget.
Importance: software engineering involve creation of software applications and systems that power the modern life and aids in areas like communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Developement of a progrogramming languages like FORTAN and C
2. The establishment of Software Engiineering as a principle in 1960's
3. The advent or start of structured programmingin the 1970's
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirenments: involves gathering and documenting the user needs and the system requirenments.
2. Design: design phase involves creation of a high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation Phase:  coding and building the software according to the specifications
4. Testing phase:testing the software to ensure that it meets the quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment: releasing the software to the user
6. Maintenance: enhancing the software after deployment and providing an ongoing support


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with its distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall for example construction of a building While Agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change example SCRUM

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
a qulity assurance engineer ensure that a software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager oversees the planning execution and delivery of a software project



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's provides a comprehensive tool for writing, debugging and testing codes 
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordination of works among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. changing environments
2. tight deadlines
3. Technical debts
   Strategies:
   1. effective communication
   2. agile methodologies
   3. prioritization of tasks
   4. regular reassessment of project goals and timeliness

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering entails creating questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models.
It helps to avoid getting ambiguous or confusing answers from AI and the Ai creates clear and specific questions
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: how to make cake
improved propmt: provide a step by step guide on how to bake a 1 kg vanilla cake , give a list of ingridients how to mix them and the degrees I should preheat the oven
The second prompt provide more details that guide the AI to generate a cake recipe and a specific flavor in that case.
